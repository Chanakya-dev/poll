      title: "Captain America Vs Ironman",
      description: "The fight between Captain America and Iron Man in Civil War began with a disagreement over the Sokovia Accords, which proposed government control over the Avengers. Iron Man supported the accords, believing oversight was necessary, while Captain America opposed them, valuing freedom and personal judgment. The conflict deepened when Captain defended his old friend Bucky Barnes, who was framed for a bombing, causing Tony to feel betrayed. The final breaking point came when Tony discovered that Bucky, while brainwashed, had killed his parents — and that Steve had known but kept it secret. This personal revelation led to an intense and emotional battle between the two former allies.",

      title: "Batman Vs Superman",
      description: "In a world divided by fear and power, the clash between Batman and Superman wasn’t just a fight—it was an ideological war. Superman, an all-powerful alien seen by many as a god, had his intentions questioned after a mission led to collateral damage. Batman, the dark knight of Gotham, saw this as a threat to humanity—a power too great to be left unchecked. Fueled by trauma and paranoia, Bruce Wayne prepared to take down the Man of Steel with his own mortal hands. Meanwhile, Clark Kent saw Batman as a dangerous vigilante taking justice into his own hands. Their conflict, manipulated by Lex Luthor behind the scenes, exploded into a legendary duel. Who wins when the symbol of hope faces off against the embodiment of vengeance?",

      title: "Sustainable Development Vs Urban Development",
      description: "As the world grows rapidly, we face a crucial choice: pursue Faster Development to boost economies quickly, often at the cost of nature, or adopt a path of Nature with Development, where progress is steady and sustainable. While rapid growth can bring quick results, it risks environmental destruction. On the other hand, balancing nature with progress ensures a healthier planet for future generations. The question is — should we prioritize speed, or sustainability?",
